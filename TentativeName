Good question — and a classic one from C/C++ mindset! 😄

❓ Can we print garbage values in Python arrays?
❌ No, not really.
In Python, you won’t get garbage values like in C/C++ because:

Python initializes variables explicitly.
There's no concept of uninitialized memory being exposed directly.
If you try to access an element in a list that doesn't exist, Python throws an error — not garbage.
